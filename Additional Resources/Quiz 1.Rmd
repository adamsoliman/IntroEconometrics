**1. How would you define the residual in a simple linear regression?**

The residual is the difference between the actual observed value of the outcome variable and the value predicted by the regression model. For observation ( i ), the residual is:


$\hat u_i = y_i - \hat y_i$

It represents how far the model’s prediction is from the observed data point.


**2. What does ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation do?**

**a) Definition in your own words**

Ordinary least squares chooses the regression line that fits the data as closely as possible by making the squared prediction errors as small as possible, on average.

**b) Formal definition**

OLS chooses the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared residuals:

$\min_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)\right)^2$



**3. Interpret each coefficient in the regression**

The estimated regression is:

$\widehat{\text{overdose deaths}} = 24.39 + 0.0505 \times \text{per capita pills}$


* **Intercept (24.39):**
  When per capita pill dispensing is equal to zero, the model predicts approximately 24.4 overdose deaths in a county-year. This is a mechanical prediction from the linear model and may not correspond to a realistic or observed scenario.

* **Slope coefficient on per capita pills (0.0505):**
  A one-unit increase in per capita pill dispensing is associated with an increase of about 0.05 overdose deaths in a county in a given year, on average, according to the linear regression model.


**4. What is the implicit assumption we discussed that one must be careful to consider when using OLS?**

The key assumption discussed is **linearity**. OLS assumes that the relationship between the explanatory variable (per capita pill dispensing) and the outcome variable (overdose deaths) can be well approximated by a straight line. If the true relationship is nonlinear, the linear regression model may provide a poor or misleading summary of the relationship.
