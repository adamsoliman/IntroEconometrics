		\item My first job was teaching math and economics in Dubai

%\pause 
		\item I study topics in the economics of crime \& some research questions of interest include
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item What are the impacts of cracking down on rogue doctors during the opioid epidemic on street drug prices, overdose mortality, and other doctors behavior?
			\item Do police respond to changes in punishment severity?
			\item What happens to neighborhood crime when investors buy many properties?

\begin{frame}{\bf \large What is econometrics?}
	
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	The statistical toolkit (techniques and methods) used to answer economic \underline{questions} with \underline{data}
	\bigskip 
	
	\pause
	What types of questions might we be interested in: 
	\medskip
	
	\begin{wideenumerate}
		\item<1-> Has economic inequality increased since 1960?
		\begin{wideitemize}
			\item<3-> \textbf{Descriptive Question:} asks about how things are (or were) in reality
		\end{wideitemize}
		\item<1-> \href{http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf}{Does raising the minimum wage reduce employment for low-skilled workers?}
		\begin{wideitemize}
			\item<4-> \textbf{Causal Question:} What would have happened in a counterfactual world?  
		\end{wideitemize}
		\item<1->   What will the unemployment rate be next quarter?
		\begin{wideitemize}
			\item<5-> \textbf{Forecasting Question:} What will happen in the future?  
		\end{wideitemize}

	\end{wideenumerate}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\bf \large Causal questions will be our focus in this course}
	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item[] More causal questions:
\begin{wideenumerate}
	\item \href{http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf}{Does immigration \emph{lead to} lower wages and/or higher unemployment for locals? }
	
	\item \href{http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/causal_educ_earnings.pdf}{Does getting a college degree \emph{afford} higher wages? }
	
	\item \href{https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp1434.pdf}{Do higher public debt levels \emph{lead to} lower economic growth? }
	\item \href{https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/133/3/1107/4850660}{ Does the
		neighborhood you grew up in have an \emph{impact} on your life outcomes?}
\end{wideenumerate}

\pause 

			\item Note that many other factors could have caused each of these outcomes
			\item Often, weâ€™ll want to focus on the causal impact of just one of these factors (immigration, minimum wage, education, etc.)
			\item Econometrics is about spelling out \textit{conditions} under which we can \textit{claim to measure causal relationships}
			\item We will encounter most basic of those conditions, and talk about some potential pitfalls

	\end{wideitemize}

\section{Why is Econometrics Challenging?}
	\begin{frame}[plain, noframenumbering]{\bf \large Outline}
	\tableofcontents[currentsection]
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{\bf \large Why is answering these questions hard?}

\begin{wideitemize}
\item
For descriptive questions: we only observe data for a \textbf{sample} of individuals, not for the full \textbf{population}
	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item 
		Example: we want to know how the distribution of income in the US has changed, but we only observe income for a survey of workers
	\end{wideitemize}
%\pause

\item Best case scenario: Our sample is \textbf{randomly} selected from the population \\
	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item 
		For example, workers in the survey were drawn out of hat with names of all possible workers

	\end{wideitemize}

%\pause 

\item Worst case scenario: Our sample is \textit{not representative} of the population that we care about
	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item For example, workers with certain characteristics were more likely to respond to the survey
	\end{wideitemize}
\end{wideitemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{\bf \large An example from before we were born \only<2-2>{$\implies$ error known as \textit{selection bias}}}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.4\linewidth]{figs/dewey-defeats-truman}
\begin{wideitemize}
	\item 
	In 1948, Chicago Tribune writes that Thomas Dewey defeats Harry Truman in the 1948 presidential election, based on survey of voters.
	
	\pause
	\item
	But their survey was conducted by phone. In 1948, only rich people had phones: sample $\neq$ population $\implies$ misleading results! 
\end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{\bf \large Why is answering these questions hard? (Part II)}
\begin{wideitemize}
	\item
	Answering causal questions is often \textit{even harder} than descriptive ones because they involve \underline{both} a descriptive component (what are outcomes in reality?) and a \textit{counterfactual} component (how would things have been under a different treatment?)
	
	\pause
	\item
	Example: what is the causal effect on your earnings of going to Clemson instead of USC? 
		\begin{wideitemize}
			\item
			Descriptive Question: how much do Clemson students earn after graduation? 
			
			\item
			Counterfactual Question: how much would Clemson students have earned if they went to USC?  
		\end{wideitemize}
		

	\item Counterfactual questions can't ever be answered with data alone. Need additional assumptions to learn about them!	
\end{wideitemize}	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{\bf \large What is the causal effect on your earnings of going to Clemson instead of USC? \\ {\normalsize How to answer this? Potential paths forward}}
\begin{wideenumerate}
	\item Compare averages from each group, but what is this missing?
	\item Run a randomized control trial
	\item Use non-experimental econometric techniques
\end{wideenumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[label=splitprob]{\bf \large Splitting up the problem}
	\begin{wideitemize}
		
		\item
		When thinking about causal questions, it's often easier to split the problem in two
		
		\item
		\textbf{Identification:} what could we learn about the parameters we care about (causal effects) if we had the \text{observable data} for the entire population
		\begin{wideitemize}
			\item 
			Need to make assumptions about how observed outcomes relate to outcomes that would have been realized under different treatments
		\end{wideitemize}
		
		\item
		\textbf{Statistics}: what can we learn about the full population that we care about from the finite sample that we have?
			\begin{wideitemize}
				\item 
				Need to understand the process by which our data is generated from the full population
			\end{wideitemize}

\begin{frame}{\bf \large Let's add some math...by introducing \textbf{potential outcomes} notation}
	\begin{wideitemize}
		
		\item $D_i$ = indicator if get treatment (1 if Clemson, 0 if USC)
		
		
		\item $Y_i(1)$ = outcome under treatment = earnings at Clemson
		\item $Y_i(0)$ = outcome under control = earnings at USC
		
		\vspace{10mm}
		
		\item Observed outcome $Y_i$ is $Y_i(1)$ if $D_i = 1$ and $Y_i(0)$ if $D_i = 0$. ($Y_i$ is your actual earnings)
		
		\item
		We can write the observed outcome as $Y_i = D_i Y_i(1) + (1-D_i) Y_i(0)$

\begin{frame}{\bf \large What is the causal effect on earnings of going to Clemson instead of USC?}
	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item
		\textbf{Sample}: $(Y_i,D_i)$ for $i=1,...N$. Data with earnings and where you went to school
		
		\pause 
		
		\item
		\textbf{Estimator}: Difference in sample mean of earnings for people who went to Clemson and people who went to USC: 
		
		$$ \underbrace{\frac{1}{N_1} \sum_{i:D_i=1} Y_i}_{\text{Avg earnings at Clemson in sample}} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{N_0} \sum_{i:D_i=0} Y_i}_{\text{Avg earnings at USC in sample}}$$		
		
		
		\pause
		\item
		\textbf{Estimand}: 
		Difference in population mean of earnings for people went to Clemson and people who went to USC: 
		
		$$\underbrace{ E[ Y_i | D_i = 1] }_{\text{Avg earnings at Clemson in population}} - \underbrace{E[Y_i | D_i = 0]}_{\text{Avg earnings at USC in population}}$$
		
		\pause 
		
		\item \textbf{Target parameter}: Causal effect of Clemson for Clemson students:
		$\underbrace{E[Y_i(1) | D_i =1]}_{\text{Earnings at Clemson for Clemson students in pop}} - \underbrace{E[Y_i(0) | D_i = 1]}_{\text{Earnings at USC for Clemson students in pop}} $ 
	\end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{\bf \large Why is causal identification hard?}
	
	\begin{wideitemize}
		
		\item
		Thought experiment: suppose we had data on earnings for \textit{every} Clemson and USC graduate
		
		
		\item
		We can learn from the data:
		$$\color{teal} \underbrace{E[ Y_i(1) | D_i=1  ] }_{\text{Earnings at Clemson for Clemson Students}} \hspace{0.5cm}  \text{and} \hspace{0.5cm} \underbrace{E[Y_i(0) | D_i = 0]	}_{\text{Earnings at USC for USC students}}$$
		
		\pause 
		\item
		The causal effect of Clemson for Clemson students is 
		$$ \color{teal}{\underbrace{E[ Y_i(1) | D_i=1  ] }_{\text{Earnings at Clemson for Clemson Students}}} - \color{red}{ \underbrace{E[ Y_i(0) | D_i=1  ] }_{\text{Earnings at USC for Clemson Students}}}$$ 
		
		\pause 
		\item
		The data doesn't tell us $\color{red}{ \underbrace{E[ Y_i(0) | D_i=1 ] }_{\text{Earnings at USC for Clemson Students}}}$. Why not? 
		%\pause			\begin{wideitemize} \item Because we never see Clemson students going to USC! \end{wideitemize} 
		
	\end{wideitemize}
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item
		One idea to solve this problem would be to assume that: 
		
		$$ \color{red}{ \underbrace{E[ Y_i(0) | D_i=1  ] }_{\text{Earnings at USC for Clemson Students}}} = \color{teal}{ \underbrace{E[ Y_i(0) | D_i=0 ] }_{\text{Earnings at USC for USC Students}}}$$
		
		\item
		Why might this give us the wrong answer? 
		
		\pause
		
		\item
		Because Clemson students may be different from USC students in other ways that would affect their earnings (regardless of where they went to college)
		
		\begin{wideitemize}
			\item 
			Academic ability, family background, career goals, etc.
		\end{wideitemize}
		
		\item
		These differences are referred to as \textit{omitted variables} or \textit{confounding factors}
	\end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\bf \large What about experiments?}
	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item
		The gold standard for learning about causal effects is a randomized controlled trial (RCT), aka experiment
		
		\item
		Suppose that the Clemson and USC administration randomized who got into which college (assume these are the only 2 colleges for simplicity)
		
		\item
		Since college is randomly assigned, the only thing that differs between Clemson and USC students is the college they went to
		
		\item
		Hence, 
		
		$$ \color{red}{ \underbrace{E[ Y_i(0) | D_i=1  ] }_{\text{Earnings at USC for Clemson Students}}} = \color{teal}{ \underbrace{E[ Y_i(0) | D_i=0 ] }_{\text{Earnings at USC for USC Students}}}$$
		
		since we've eliminated any confounding factors
		
		
	\end{wideitemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\bf \large But running experiments is often hard/impossible \hyperlink{splitprob}{\beamergotobutton{Back}}}
	\begin{wideitemize}
		
		\item
		Unfortunately, Clemson/USC have not let us randomize who gets into which college
		\begin{wideitemize}
			\item
			At least not yet! If you could convince them to do this, it'd make for a cool senior thesis! 
		\end{wideitemize}
		
		
		\item
		Likewise, it is difficult to convince states to randomize their minimum wages, or other policies
		
		\item
		In some cases, randomization is not just difficult but would be immoral 
		
		\begin{wideitemize}
			\item 
			``What is the causal effect of spousal death on labor supply?''
		\end{wideitemize}	
		
		\item
		In this course, we'll discuss tools economists try to use when running experiments is not possible
