## What is `R`?

`R` is a __programming language__ with powerful statistical and graphic capabilities.

--

## Why are we using `R`?

--

1. `R` is __free__ and __open source__—saving both you and the university 💰💵💰.

1. `R` is very __flexible and powerful__—adaptable to nearly any task, (data cleaning, data visualization, econometrics, spatial data analysis, machine learning, web scraping, etc.)

1. `R` has a vibrant, [thriving online community](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) that will (almost) always have a solution to your problem.

1. If you put in the work, you will come away with a __very valuable and useful__ tool.

---

# Why can't we just use Excel?

Many reasons but here are just a few:

- Not ***reproducible***.

- Not straightforward to ***merge*** datasets together.

- Very fastidious to ***clean*** data.

- Limited to ***small datasets***.

- Not designed for proper ***econometric analyses***, maps, complex visualisations, etc.

# First Taste of R

# In Practice: Data Wrangling

--

* You will spend a lot of time preparing data for further analysis.

--

* The `gapminder` dataset contains data on life expectancy, GDP per capita and population by country between 1952 and 2007.

* Suppose we want to know the average life expectancy and average GDP per capita for each continent in each year.

* We need to group the data by continent *and* year, then compute the average life expectancy and average GDP per capita

--

.pull-left[
```{r, gapminder, echo = T, eval = F}
# load gapminder package
library(gapminder)
# load the dataset from the gapminder package
data(gapminder, package = "gapminder") 
# show first 4 lines of this dataframe
head(gapminder,n = 4)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, gapminder, echo = F, eval = T}
```
]

---

# In Practice: Data Wrangling

* There are always several ways to achieve a goal. (As in life 😁)

* Here we will only focus on the `dplyr` way:

```{r}
# compute the required statistics
gapminder_dplyr <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean_lifeexp = mean(lifeExp),
            mean_gdppercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```

```{r}
# show first 5 lines of the new data
head(gapminder_dplyr, n = 5)
```

---

# Visualization

.pull-left[
* Now we could *look* at the result in `gapminder_dplyr`, or compute some statistics from it. 

* Nothing beats a picture, though:

```{r gampminder_plot, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_dplyr, 
       mapping = aes(x = mean_lifeexp,
                     y = mean_gdppercap,
                     color = continent,
                     size = count)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/2) +
  labs(x = "Average life expectancy",
       y = "Average GDP per capita",
       color = "Continent",
       size = "Nb of countries") +
  theme_bw()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r gampminder_plot, echo = FALSE}
```
]

# Animated Plotting 👌

```{r, example: gganimate, include = F, cache = T}
# The package for animating ggplot2
library(gganimate)
# As before
# gg <- ggplot(
#   data = gapminder %>% filter(continent != "Oceania"),
#   aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color = country)
# ) +
# geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
# scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
# scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
# scale_x_log10("GDP per capita", label = scales::comma) +
# facet_wrap(~continent) +
# theme_pander(base_size = 16) +
# theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "grey90", fill = NA)) +
# # Here comes the gganimate-specific bits
# labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}") +
# ylab("Life Expectancy") +
# transition_time(year) +
# ease_aes("linear")
# # Save the animation
# anim_save(
#   animation = gg,
#   filename = "ex_gganimate.gif",
#   path = "chapter_in1les/figure-html",
#   width = 9,
#   height = 4,
#   units = "in",
#   res = 150,
#   nframes = 56

# R 101: Here Is Where You Start

---

# Start your `RStudio`!

## First Glossary of Terms

* `R`: a programming language.

* `RStudio`: an integrated development environment (IDE) to work with `R`.

* *command*: user input (text or numbers) that `R` *understands*.

* *script*: a list of commands collected in a text file, each separated by a new line, to be run one after the other.

* To run a script, you need to highlight the relevant code lines and hit `Ctrl`+`Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd`+`Enter` (Mac).

---

# `RStudio` Layout

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter_intro_files/figure-html/rstudio.png")
```

---

# R as a Calculator

* You can use the `R` console like a calculator

* Just type an arithmetic operation after `>` and hit `Enter`!

* Some basic arithmetic first:
```{r}
4 + 1
8 / 2
```


* Great! What about this?
```{r}
2^3
# by the way: this is a comment! R therefore disregards it
```

---

# Where to get Help?

.pull-left[
`R` built-in `help`:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?log #? in front of function
help(lm)   # help() is equivalent
??plot  # get all help on keyword "plot"
```
]

.pull-right[

]

---

# Collaborate!

---

# R Packages

* `R` users contribute add-on data and functions as *packages*

* Installing packages is easy! Just use the `install.packages` function:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    ```

* To *use* the contents of a package, we must load it from our library using `library`:
    ```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,eval=FALSE}
    library(ggplot2)
    ```

---

# Vectors



.pull-left[
* The `c` function creates vectors, i.e. *one-dimensional arrays*.
    ```{r}
    c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
    ```
    
* Coercion to unique types:
    ```{r}
    (v <- c(42, "Statistics", TRUE))
    ```
]

.pull-right[

* Creating a *range*
    ```{r}
    1:10
    ```

* get vector elements with square bracket operator `[index]`:
    ```{r}
    v[c(1,3)]
    ```
]

---

# `data.frame`s

`data.frame`s represent **tabular data**. Like spreadsheets.

```{r}
example_data = data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5, 7),
                          y = c(rep("Hello", 3), "Goodbye"),
                          z = c("one", 2, "three", 4))
example_data
```

* A `data.frame` has 2 dimensions: *rows* and *columns*. Like a *matrix*. Can get elements with `[row_index,col_index]`.

* In practice, you will be importing files that contain the data into `R` rather than creating `data.frame`s by hand.

---

# `data.frame`s

Useful functions to describe a dataframe:
```{r}
murders <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/zuk0qcfm3kyzs4e/gun_murders.csv?dl=1")
str(murders) # `str` describes structure of any R object
```

--

```{r}
names(murders) # column names
```

```{r}
nrow(murders) # number of rows
```

```{r}
ncol(murders) # number of columns
```

---

# Accessing `data.frame` Columns
    
* To extract one column **as a vector** we can use the `$` operator (as in `murders$state`), or the square bracket operator `[which_index]` with name or position index:
    ```{r}
    first5 <- murders[1:5, ]  # take first 5 states only
    first5$state  # extract with $ operator
    first5[ ,"state"]  # extract with column name
    first5[ ,1] # get first column
    ```

--

.pull-left[
* Check `class` of an object:
    ```{r}
    class(murders)
    ```
]

.pull-right[
* `typeof` gives the R-internal data type:
    ```{r}
    typeof(murders)
    ```
]

---

# Subsetting `data.frames`

* Subsetting a data.frame: `murders[row condition, column number]` or `murders[row condition, "column name"]`
    ```{r}
    # Only keep states with over 500 gun murders and keep only the "state" and "total" variables
    murders[murders$total > 500, c("state", "total")]
    
    # Only keep California and Texas and keep only the "state" and "total" variables
    murders[murders$state %in% c("California", "Texas"), c("state", "total")]
    ```

```{r makepdf, echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
system("decktape chapter1.html chapter1.pdf --chrome-arg=--disable-web-security")

This was just a brief introduction, so do not worry if it felt like a lot. Not only are there tons of resources online (such as those referenced on the course website and in lecture notes), but you have a weekly lab that is dedicated to R and Econometrics. 

### Moving forward, you will be using R in every class with various tasks (i.e., implementing things you are learning in real time), so bring your laptop AND BEFORE NEXT CLASS, install R and RStudio using instructions from [this link](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html). 

Note that [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/index.html) more generally is another useful resource.
