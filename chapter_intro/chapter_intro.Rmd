## What is `R`?

`R` is a __programming language__ with powerful statistical and graphic capabilities.

--

## Why are we using `R`?

1. `R` is __free__ and __open source__‚Äîsaving both you and the university üí∞üíµüí∞.

1. `R` is very __flexible and powerful__‚Äîadaptable to nearly any task, (data cleaning, data visualization, econometrics, spatial data analysis, machine learning, web scraping, etc.)

1. `R` has a vibrant, [thriving online community](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) that will (almost) always have a solution to your problem.

1. If you put in the work, you will come away with a __very valuable and useful__ tool.

--

### Moving forward, you will be using R in every class with various tasks (i.e., implementing things you are learning in real time), so always bring your laptop (and you should have already installed R and RStudio using instructions from [this link](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html))

---

# Why can't we just use Excel?

Many reasons but here are just a few:

- Not ***reproducible***.

- Not straightforward to ***merge*** datasets together.

- Very fastidious to ***clean*** data.

- Limited to ***small datasets***.

- Not designed for proper ***econometric analyses***, maps, complex visualisations, etc.

# In Practice: Data Wrangling

* You will spend a lot of time preparing data for further analysis.

--

* The `gapminder` dataset contains data on life expectancy, GDP per capita and population by country between 1952 and 2007.

* Suppose we want to know the average life expectancy and average GDP per capita for each continent in each year.

* We need to group the data by continent *and* year, then compute the average life expectancy and average GDP per capita

--

.pull-left[
```{r, gapminder, echo = T, eval = F}
# load gapminder package
library(gapminder)
# load the dataset from the gapminder package
data(gapminder, package = "gapminder") 
# show first 4 lines of this dataframe
head(gapminder,n = 4)
# how many rows in the dataset?
nrow(gapminder)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, gapminder, echo = F, eval = T}
```
]

---

# In Practice: Data Wrangling

* There are always several ways to achieve a goal, as in life üòÅ, and we only focus on the `dplyr` way:

```{r}
# compute the required statistics
gapminder_dplyr <- gapminder %>% group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(), mean_lifeexp = mean(lifeExp), mean_gdppercap = mean(gdpPercap))
```

```{r}
# show first 5 lines of the new data
head(gapminder_dplyr, n = 5)
# how many rows in the dataset
nrow(gapminder_dplyr)
```

---

# Visualization

.pull-left[
* Now we could *look* at the result in `gapminder_dplyr`, or compute some statistics from it. 

* Nothing beats a picture, though:

```{r gampminder_plot, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_dplyr, 
       mapping = aes(x = mean_lifeexp,
                     y = mean_gdppercap,
                     color = continent,
                     size = count)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/2) +
  labs(x = "Average life expectancy",
       y = "Average GDP per capita",
       color = "Continent",
       size = "Nb of countries") +
  theme_bw()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r gampminder_plot, echo = FALSE}
```

# Animated Plotting üëå

```{r, example: gganimate, include = F, cache = T}
# The package for animating ggplot2
library(gganimate)
# As before
# gg <- ggplot(
#   data = gapminder %>% filter(continent != "Oceania"),
#   aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color = country)
# ) +
# geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
# scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
# scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
# scale_x_log10("GDP per capita", label = scales::comma) +
# facet_wrap(~continent) +
# theme_pander(base_size = 16) +

# R 101: Here Is Where You Start

---

# Start your `RStudio`!

## First Glossary of Terms

* `R`: a programming language.

* `RStudio`: an integrated development environment (IDE) to work with `R`.

* *command*: user input (text or numbers) that `R` *understands*.

* *script*: a list of commands collected in a text file, each separated by a new line, to be run one after the other.

* To run a script, you need to highlight the relevant code lines and hit `Ctrl`+`Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd`+`Enter` (Mac).

---

# `RStudio` Layout

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter_intro_files/figure-html/rstudio.png")
```

---

# R as a Calculator

* You can use the `R` console like a calculator

* Just type an arithmetic operation after `>` and hit `Enter`!

* Some basic arithmetic first:
```{r}
4 + 1
8 / 2
```


* Great! What about this?
```{r}
2^3
# by the way: this is a comment! R therefore disregards it
```

---

# Where to get Help?

.pull-left[
`R` built-in `help`:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?log #? in front of function
help(lm)   # help() is equivalent
??plot  # get all help on keyword "plot"
```
]

# Collaborate!

---

# R Packages

* `R` users contribute add-on data and functions as *packages*

* Installing packages is easy! Just use the `install.packages` function:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    ```

* To *use* the contents of a package, we must load it from our library using `library`:
    ```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,eval=FALSE}
    library(ggplot2)
    ```

---

# `data.frame` and useful functions to describe one

`data.frame`s represent **tabular data**. Like spreadsheets.

```{r}
murders <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/zuk0qcfm3kyzs4e/gun_murders.csv?dl=1")
str(murders) # `str` describes structure of any R object
```

--

```{r}
variable.names(murders) # column names
```

```{r}
ncol(murders) # number of columns. what is the function for rows? yup, its nrow()
```

---

# Let's try some basic R

1\. Create a new R script (File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ R Script). Save it somewhere as `lecture_intro.R`.

2\. Type the following code in your script and run it. You can either highlight the code or just put your cursor at the end of the line and click `Run` in the top right corner. Short cut to run code: press `Ctrl` or `Cmd` + `Enter`. 
```{r}
4 * 8
```

3\. Type the following code in your script and run it. What happens if you only run the first line of the code?
```{r}
x = 5 # equivalently x <- 5
x
```

**If I only run the first line of code, the object `x` is created in my environment but no output appears in the console. This is because I am not asking `R` to output anything; the only thing I am asking it is to create an object `x` equal to $5$.**

Congratulations, you have created your first `R` "object"! Everything is an object in R! Objects are assigned using `=` or `<-`.

# Let's move on to some real data...about Clemson football!

1\. Find out (using `help()` or google) how to import a .csv file. Do NOT use the "Import Dataset" button, nor install a package. The first Google entry is [this](https://teacherscollege.screenstepslive.com/a/1122473-import-data-in-r-csv-files-into-r-studio)...

--

2\. In the same script used in the previous task, import [clemsonFBSfinances.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6izns6n1iobin3shafpfr/clemsonFBSfinances.csv?rlkey=s2prx9z1lhmmym96cubzi7awe&dl=1) in a new object and call it `clemsonfootballdata`. This file contains data on Clemson football finances. It should look something like:
 
```{r}
# this is a comment, which you should always use in your code. Note your path will look slightly different
clemsonfootballdata <- read.csv("/Users/adamsoliman/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Clemson/Econometrics Course/data for tasks/clemsonFBSfinances.csv")

#alternatively, you can import directly from dropbox
clemsonfootballdata <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6izns6n1iobin3shafpfr/clemsonFBSfinances.csv?rlkey=s2prx9z1lhmmym96cubzi7awe&dl=1")
```

3\. Type in `class(clemsonfootball)` in your script and run the code. What happened and why? Now try with `class(clemsonfootballdata)`.


4\. Find out what variables are contained in `clemsonfootballdata` by running `names(clemsonfootballdata)` in your script.

5\. View the contents of the dataset by clicking on `clemsonfootballdata` in your workspace. What does the `Medical` variable correspond to?

6\. Find out what years are in the dataset by running `table(clemsonfootballdata$Year)`. What is the unit of observation?

7\. How many observations are there in `clemsonfootballdata`? Use `nrow(clemsonfootballdata)`.

This was just a brief introduction, so do not worry if it felt like a lot. Not only are there tons of resources online (such as those referenced on the course website and in lecture notes), but you have a weekly lab that is dedicated to R and Econometrics. 

Note that [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/index.html) more generally is another useful resource.
